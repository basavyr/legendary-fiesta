# Projecting the classical trajectories of the $^{163}$Lu triaxial nucleus onto a plane

**Goal:** From the classical trajectories of the triaxial spin states inside this isotope (given by the intersection of the *energy ellipsoid* and the *angular momentum sphere*), the projection of such trajectories must be represented onto a plane generated by any of the two angular momentum components (namely, $x_1$, $x_2$ or $x_3$).

Once the trajectories of the nucleus are determined (as a function of the Energy value for a given spin-state from one of the four TSD bands), their projections need to be added on a 2d graphical representation.
