This project aims at solving two major goals:

1. Calculating and visualizing the energy functions $\mathcal{H}$ for $^{135}$Pr in terms of classical trajectories. The trajectories are given by the conservation laws for the energy the angular-momentum conservation of the triaxial nucleus.
2. ðŸš€ **Update (Nov. 2020):** From the obtained classical trajectories (i.e. given as the intersection of the angular momentum sphere with the energy ellipsoid), develop a 2-dimensional representation of the trajectories for a given spin-state, for multiple energies.
